Robert's workspace for asset inventory and existing controls review (Step 3 and 6)
<h1>🔐 Lex Retail Stores – Cybersecurity Architecture Report</h1>

<h2>Section: Technical Infrastructure – Identify & Protect</h2>
<h2>Analyst: Robert</h2>
<h2>Step 3: Asset Inventory</h2>
<h2>Aligned Standard: ISO/IEC 27001:2022 – Control A.5.9 (Inventory of Information and Other Associated Assets)</h2>
<h3>1. Objective</h3>
To identify, classify, and document all assets associated with Lex Retail’s digital infrastructure, including servers, endpoints, and platforms. This step enables Lex Retail to understand its attack surface and implement protective measures in accordance with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (Identify & Protect) and ISO 27001 A.5.9 requirements.

<br />
<h3>2. Tools Used</h3>

- <b>Packet tracer – To do a design simulation showing the organizations structure.</b>
- <b>Nmap – To detect active hosts, open ports, and services.</b>
- <b>Netdiscover – To identify live hosts and MAC addresses on the local network.</b>
- <b>Browser + WordPress Admin Panel – To inspect plugin settings, security gaps, and missing configurations like 2FA or firewalls.</b>
<h3>3. Findings</h3>
<h3>A. Mini Network in Packet Tracer Simulating Lex retail assets</h3>

<br />
<br />
The above image shows a simulated nmap logic type scan showing that http port 80 is open and note that nmap scan can not be done in packet tracer so we decided to simulated further ideas to show case the presence of a possible nmap scan.<br />
<img src="https://imgur.com/8FfZn5i.png="cybersecurityarchitect"/>
<br />
<br />
The above shows the presence of an open port on port 21 ftp and this can also be show on an nmap scan output but am substituting the idea with this approach because nmap scans can’t be done in packet tracer.<br />

<h3>4. ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Alignment – Control A.5.9</h3>
<h3>Control A.5.9 requires organizations to:</h3>
“Identify and document inventories of assets relevant to information processing and associated information systems.”

<br />
<h3>This inventory satisfies baseline compliance by:</h3>

- <b>Identifying and documenting all critical and supporting assets.</b>
- <b>Mapping asset roles and data classification.</b>
- <b>Supporting future control implementation (e.g., protection, monitoring, access restriction).</b>
- <b>Assign Asset Ownership.</b>
- <b>Track Asset Lifecycle.</b>

<h3>Purpose of This Control:</h3>

- <b>Ensure all critical assets (devices, software, data, etc.) are known, tracked, and assigned ownership.</b>
- <b>Enable proper risk management, incident response, and protection measures.</b>

<h3>5. Next Steps</h3>

- <b>Implement a formal asset inventory register in spreadsheet or CMDB tool.</b>
- <b>Schedule regular rescans (monthly/quarterly) to detect unauthorized devices.</b>
- <b>Apply WordPress hardening and install firewall + 2FA plugins.</b>
- <b>Tag high-risk assets for prioritized protection in the next project phase.</b>

<h3>Step 6: Control Review – Endpoint Protection, Access Control, MFA, Encryption</h3>
Lex Retail Stores’ current protective measures were reviewed, focusing on role-based access control (RBAC), data encryption, antivirus use, patch management, and multi-factor authentication (MFA). The review highlights both implemented and missing controls based on ISO/IEC 27001:2022 standards, particularly:

- <b>A.5.17 – Authentication Information.</b>
- <b>A.5.18 – Access Rights.</b>
- <b>A.8.24 – Use of Cryptography.</b>
<br />

Lex Retail Stores’ current protective measures highlights:

- <b>Who can access what (Access Control / RBAC).</b>
- <b>How accounts are secured (Authentication / MFA).</b>
- <b>How devices are protected (Antivirus / Endpoint Security).</b>
- <b>How data is protected (Encryption / Patching).</b>
<br />

### Step 6: Control Review – Summary Table

| 🔐 Control Area                   | 📋 Current State / Plan                                | ⚠️ Gaps Identified                                             |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧑‍💼 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) | Basic role assignment in Google Workspace              | No clear privilege separation for admin vs staff               |
| 🔒 Encryption                    | TLS for email, HTTPS enforced on website               | No endpoint disk encryption (BitLocker/FileVault)              |
| 🛡️ Antivirus & Patching         | Built-in OS antivirus active (Windows Defender)        | No centralized antivirus control, irregular patching           |
| 🔑 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)| Not enabled across all Google accounts               | High-risk: Accounts accessible with just passwords             |
| 📱 Mobile Device Management (MDM) | Not implemented                                        | No enforcement on BYOD or company-issued mobile devices        |

<h3>Screenshot Evidence:</h3>
A screenshot from the Google Workspace Admin Console shows:

- <b>MFA not enforced for all accounts.</b>
- <b>Weak RBAC configuration (e.g., multiple staff accounts with admin privileges).</b>
- <b>Risk dashboard displaying account exposure alerts.</b>
<br />
Screenshot from a Windows system shows:
- <b>BitLocker encryption status set to "Off" or "Not enabled".</b>
- <b>Windows Defender either turned off or showing "At risk" status.</b>
- <b>No third-party antivirus or patch management platform detected.</b>
- <bNo MDM client or policy found on staff device, confirming lack of endpoint control.</b>
