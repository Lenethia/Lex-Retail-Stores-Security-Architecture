## Step 2: Risk Identification and Assessment

Lex Retail Stores is an online retail startup with 20 employees and no existing cybersecurity infrastructure. This assessment identifies the companyâ€™s top cybersecurity risks, based on its current systems, technologies, and business model. Risks were assessed using a basic qualitative matrix measuring likelihood and potential impact.

### Methodology

- Used NIST CSF Identify Function to guide risk assessment.
- Analysed SME's infrastructure, business processes, and user behaviours.
- Assigned qualitative risk ratings (Low, Medium, High) based on threat exposure and asset value.

### Summary Risk Matrix

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Impact | Likelihood | Risk Level |
|--------|------------------|--------|------------|------------|
| R1 | Customer PII exposure due to lack of data encryption and access control | High | High | **Critical** |
| R2 | Payment data compromise via insecure plugins or poor Stripe configuration | High | Medium | **High** |
| R3 | Vendor account misuse due to weak authentication and no vetting | Medium | High | **High** |
| R4 | Malware infections from shared, unmanaged employee laptops | Medium | Medium | **Medium** |
| R5 | Loss of business data (orders, inventory) due to no backups | High | Low | **Medium** |
| R6 | Insider threats due to shared logins and no monitoring | Medium | Medium | **Medium** |
| R7 | Non-compliance with POPIA/GDPR due to outdated privacy policy | Medium | High | **High** |

### Key Risk Themes

- **Sensitive data is unprotected**: Customer PII and transaction data are at risk.
- **No access control**: Shared devices and logins increase exposure.
- **No vendor screening**: Anyone can upload potentially malicious content.
- **Lack of monitoring**: No visibility into unauthorised access or changes.
- **Regulatory non-compliance**: No adherence to POPIA or GDPR.

### Next Steps

These risks will guide the mapping of NIST CSF controls (Step 7) and inform which controls from ISO/IEC 27001 are critical to implement first. Key risks will also be prioritised in the testing and mitigation plan (Step 10).
